 sen: Knowledge from experience is more important than that from books. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Whereas, it is easy to put knowledge from experience in real life because it is acquired from what have happened to them. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: The purpose of my writing is to deeply discuss these sources of knowledge in two important aspects: accuracy and practicability, and to show my greater interest in knowledge accumulated from experience. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Meanwhile, knowledge from experience seems a little different from information contained in books. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Meanwhile, if he goes to the library and carries out the reactions, he is certain to have a thorough grasp of the phenomena seen. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Experiencing a thing and drawing information from it is really interesting and helpful. prediction: --Claim--
 sen: Nevertheless, there is an increased likelihood that he neither remembers the necessary information for a long time nor knows how to do an make an experiment. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: What is worse, the workers have to consume more time and traffic fees. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: With the booming development of some cosmopolitan metropolises in recent years, an increasing number of people are flooding into these major cities, raising such urban problems as traffic jams or housing shortage. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Thus, these employers have to commute between the cities and the countryside, which is ineffective in tackling traffic and housing problems. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: This can be best illustrated with the example of the married workers. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: As companies and factories move to the countryside, they may deplete the local natural resources as the raw materials for production. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: However, the proposed measure is not fundamental to resolve urban traffic and housing problems. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Instead, the government should be forward-looking, resolving the problems within the cities. prediction: --Claim--
 sen: As people work in the countryside, they will not have to commute in cities at peak times such as eight o'clock in the morning or six o'clock in the afternoon. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: This is because some employees are reluctant to live in the rural areas only due to the relocation of their workplaces. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: In such cases, some people think an effective way to tackle these problems is to relocate big firms, factories and their employees in cities to the countryside. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Also, the suggested step can bring about environmental problems in the rural areas. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Admittedly, moving big companies, factories and their employees to the rural area can help ease traffic congestion and housing scarcity. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Solve traffic and housing problems by moving companies to the rural areas? prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Besides, the untreated pollutants the plants discharge can be damaging to the rural environment .Therefore, moving companies, factories and employees to the rural areas can ruin the environment there. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Consequently, urban traffic jam can be, to some extent, relieved in this respect. prediction: --Claim--
 sen: Overall, I would conclude that relocating big firms, factories and their employees is not sensible to address urban traffic and housing problems. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: On the other hand, the relocation of companies and factories in cities may leave more space to build new residential areas, thus alleviating the urban housing crisis at present. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Today, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Furthermore, it is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: To illustrate this further, the famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: For example, paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: In short, without any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Artists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: First and foremost, if there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Nonetheless, I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: To cite an example, Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Advertising - positive or negative part of our lives. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. prediction: --Claim--
 sen: In conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Nowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Thus i suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes. prediction: --Claim--
 sen: The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Last centuary has witnesed the horrors of such weapons. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: As far as my opinion is concerned , I find myself aligned with opponenets of the usages of nuclear power. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Last but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for millitary usage. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are unevitable. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanat solution of it. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazordous material. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone, they make themselves jobless. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Today, the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: In this context, the public's money is spent worthlessly. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Furthermore, when hand phones are provided for free, many would want to take advantage of this opportunity. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: To illustrate this further, the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: To conclude, the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: In short, if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone, they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: In a positive point of view, when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet, they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Not only that, the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money. prediction: --Claim--
 sen: Giving mobile phones to the unemployed. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: For example, they can surf the The Star Onlines' work section to find a job that is suitable for them. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: To put it in a nutshell, the suggestion of providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them. prediction: --Claim--
 sen: On top of that, till now, there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: With the help of the net, they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Nevertheless, I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Nonetheless, looking from another perspective, supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers' money. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: They are used in schools, businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: To illustrate this further, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Today, close circuit television (CCTV) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Furthermore, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Use of CCTV cameras. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Firstly, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Nevertheless, some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: At times, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: To conclude, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: In the event of an argument, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Not only that, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: In short, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Hence, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Even so, I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace. prediction: --Claim--
 sen: Admittedly, privacies are lost with the use of these cameras. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Nonetheless, safety should be put first in order to be safe. prediction: --Claim--
 sen: Nevertheless, universities are not only continuation of schooling but a platform where people start knowing more about society. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Secondly, universities playing the most important role in education system have to guarantee the knowledge conveyed is true and useful, which can be achieved through the researching function. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: However, others support that it is more reasonable to set down universities as a centre of culture life where knowledge is transferred and updated. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Some of them deem universities principally provide training for people to be qualified employees. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Firstly, imparting knowledge and educating people are basic duty of universities where people decide career direction and acquire more specialized knowledge and skills. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: teaching and researching working together lead to the success. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: The essential social capabilities such as communication skills, teamwork, leadership and time management are gradually cultivated with group workshops and various kinds of social activities in universities. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Old knowledge is applied to particular problems during research and solutions found often bring about innovations in culture and technology to promote human and communities to step forward. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Systematic and comprehensive training programs in specific fields urge people to master information required quickly and thoroughly. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Both teaching and researching working together lead to the success of today's universities. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Recently, the controversial debate surrounding universities has sparked interests among students and the media. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: To conclude, I personally believe the government should take some actions such as classifying the payment, boosting the public transport and encouraging individuals to adopt the zero-emission cars, rather than raising the price of petrol, to get rid of the traffic and pollution problems. prediction: --Claim--
 sen: For example, three family members have to work or study in three place separated so far with each other, then they need to acquire at least two cars or they may both be late. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Undeniably, making the fuel cost more money could limit the number of vehicles to some extent. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Therefore, I can hardly agree that the solution is the best. prediction: --Claim--
 sen: On the other hand, the development of automobile industry could be restrained as well as the employments offered by it, which could have negative effects on economy. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Due to the increasing number of petrol stations, the competition in this field is more and more fierce, thus the price of petrol could be lower in the future. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: In such case if they must pay more money on fuel, they may consider about that price of purchasing additionally for more time. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: However, it rises concerns about the increasingly severe traffic problems as well as the automobile exhaust pollution. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: From my mind, I think there are three ways tosolve these problems. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Firstly, a new method of expenditure classification could be adopted. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Moreover, some families purchase even more than three cars just for their own sake. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: In my experience, many people in urban areas even do not know the names of their neighbors. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Many people believe that the life in a major metropolis is convenient and interesting. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: It is clearly seen that people in large cities face annoying noise and dirty air emitted from vehicles almost everyday. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: In conclusion, I would concede that city life has its own advantages. prediction: --Claim--
 sen: This is likely to adversely affect their mental health. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: It seems to me that there are more trees and lakes in towns than in cities. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: It is wonderful that I get up early in the morning and take a walk in such a green place. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Finally, the green environment in small towns interests me. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: The relationship among them can be so close that they usually attend the birthday party of one of their neighboring people. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: I love the life in my town. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: The urban environment, however, is so artificial with only buildings and vehicles. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: The atmosphere in suburban area brings me peaceful feeling. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: I can not adapt myself to such an environment. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Finally, the environmental is greener than in cities. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: The affection from people around brings me cozy feeling on my birthday when I live away from my family. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: It is contrary in small town life, where people are ready to help whenever their neighbors are in need. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Prefer to live in a small town rather than a city. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Nonetheless, peaceful atmosphere, friendliness of people, and green landscape strongly convince me that a small town is the best place for me to live in. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: First and foremost, peaceful atmosphere is attractive. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Secondly, people in small towns are always friendly. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: These features make a suburban town the paradise for people who want to escape from suffocating lives in major cities. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Meanwhile, lives small towns are great deal more quiet and the air is always fresh. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Moreover, people there are very friendly. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Various ideas and preferences have been presented. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: By and large, each source of knowledge has its own accuracy rate. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: In conclusion, I would concede that knowledge from books is widely accepted. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Consequently, it is difficult to apply knowledge from books into practice. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: The differences between knowledge from books and from experience have erupted endless controversy. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: He is also able to use this information for the next times. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Therefore, knowledge acquired from books is greatly accepted, which means that it is right to the bulk of people. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: For instance, a student decides to learn about chemical reactions from books. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: However, I consider knowledge from experience as the more important source because of its negative impacts on real life. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: However, the result is not always the same in reality because it also depends on the height, the purity of the water, and even the measuring tool. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: This method is likely to be fast, simple, and even safe. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: It is apparent that books are often written by professors, experts, or authorities in a variety of fields. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: In my experience, information contained in books is usually put in criteria so that many people can read and understand the content. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Indeed, knowledge from experience helps people more than knowledge from books does. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Next, the practicability is one of the most essential factors of knowledge. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: To cite an example, it is common in books that water boils at 100 Celcius degree. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: First and foremost, the accuracy of knowledge is crucially important. prediction: --Premise--
 sen: Knowledge from experience is more important than that from books. prediction: --Premise--
